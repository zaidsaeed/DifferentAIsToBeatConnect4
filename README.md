This code implements the connect 4 game using C++. It also provides an AI to beat this game which uses the minimax algorithm to generate multiple possible outcomes of the game and chose the most optimal solution, given both players optimally. The code also uses alpha-beta prunning to speed up the process of finding an optimal answer and not through possible scenarios when a "good enough" scenario is found. Implementing alpha beta prunning always the code to run the minimax using depth five and taking multiple key game scenarios in mind.
